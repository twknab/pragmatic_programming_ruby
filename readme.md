# Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide

This repo is just some code that follows along with the book ["Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide"](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)

The code herein may not be fully comprehensive, and is best to follow the above link to the original material as hosted on ruby-doc.com.

This book takes you through a conceptual understanding of Ruby, into some basics, and then into the nitty gritty. The book also compares Ruby approaches to that of Python, Java or C# -- and is an informative source in gathering a unique perspective about a very cool language (in my opinion).

There are so few languages with such minimalist syntax, and with a developer-centric philosophy built into Ruby's creation.
